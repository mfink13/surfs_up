# Overview
  
  This project was initiated to determine whether or not opening a shop would be a good business decision, based on weather data.
  
## Purpose

  The purpose of was to gather weather data and manipulate it into a more user friendly format, in order to present the data to potential investors.  In order to give examples of weather in different seasons, the months of June and December were anaylyzed.
  
## Results

  The following are three key differences between the temperatures in June and December:
  
  - Minimum Temperature
    
    The lowest temperature in month of June was 64 degrees and December was 56. Although these temperatures have a 9 degree difference, the maximum temperatures only have a difference of 2 degrees - June's max is 85 and December's is 83.
    
  - Count 

    The reported temperature counts for June were almost 200 higher than those reported for December.  Though this is a a difference to note and could seem like December has incomplete data, the odds of the summary statistics of Decembers changing with more data is low.
    
  - Quartiles

    The third key difference between the June and December temperature was in the 25, 50, and 75th quartiles.  In all three, June's temperatures are higher: 4 degrees higher in the 25 and 50th quartiles, and 3 degrees in the last.
    
## Summary 

  Between the mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures, the data shows that the temperatures in June and December are both high enough, in both times of year, to support the opening of the shop.  In order to offer further data to support the opening of the shop, the precipitation of both months was also evaluated and queried. 
  The results show that the amount precipitation in June and December is low and scare enough to offer many sunny days for the potentional shop to succeed.  The following images depict the summary statitics of precipitation for both months.
